Welcome to **WTW!** — a home for my thoughts, essays, and reflections on life, learning, and technology.

I've always wanted a place to express ideas freely — a quiet corner of the web to pour straight out of my heart. This blog is my initiative towards that.

### What You'll Find Here

- Personal essays on life, philosophy, and introspection
- Occasional tech posts about things I'm learning
- Notes and reflections on books, people, and experiences

### Why Now?

Writing helps me think clearly. It helps me slow down. It forces me to **notice** within. I used to
write in notes in laptop/phone. Thought I should share my thoughts with others :) Or else just host 
it for me to access it from anywhere!

> “We do not write in order to be understood; we write in order to understand.” — C.S. Lewis

Thank you for being here. I hope what I share resonates with you, even a little.

Stay curious 🌱

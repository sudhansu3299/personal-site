description: Analogous side by side comparison of mindsets incase of idea or in the case of choosing partner?

Ever caught yourself dreaming up the next trendy pet caf√© or boutique fashion shop? 
If you‚Äôre a software engineer, maybe you‚Äôve pictured your own SaaS unicorn... or completely new quantum safe federated model using blockchain consensus! 
That's a pretty new idea , right? Sounds like the next billion dollar company, isn't it! üòé

These ideas often come in hot‚Äîsudden flashes of inspiration we cling to. We pitch them to friends, family, even colleagues (usually the least interested crowd), 
and wait for validation. But more often than not, what we get is skepticism. A flood of reasons why *this* won‚Äôt work. And here‚Äôs the twist: most of those reasons are actually valid.
But, we as humans have **bias** towards our own "generated" ideas. We don't want to listen someone 
badmouthing our idea before it has even landed. 

No dude! my idea is different. This one is definitely different & unique, unlike other ones. 
You don't even know about it properly. I have researched about it thoroughly. This one‚Äôs special! I won't get burned out
like the last time. I will make it work! on and on..... 
Does these phrases sound familiar? ü§™ (maybe in some other context)

*Paul Graham or Peter Thiel's advice won't help you , because until you‚Äôve *gone through* something end to end, advice is just theory. Because, this is
the first time you're pursuing your idea and you don't wanna lose it before really pursuing this for sometime. There is some a part of us knows they‚Äôre right‚Äîyet we cling tighter, because it‚Äôs our idea. üò≠.
Seasoned founders have better insights that help them better gauge an idea's viability, adaptability.
This is the reason why 82 % first time founders fail! You need "experience"; Not because they‚Äôre not smart or hardworking, but because they haven‚Äôt 
built the muscle yet to see the red flags, adapt early, and pace themselves.

No matter what, most probably you will fail the first time, a startup or a relationship. 
We only get better with experiences and learn from the past. 
> "Either you win or your learn!" ~ some great guy

So, take your idea seriously. Love it. Nurture it. But don‚Äôt fall into the trap of thinking it's *the one* just because it came to you first. There are a billion people
with zillion ideas! Someone might have got it too, it's all about the execution! Let it evolve. Let *you* evolve.

Keep trying, keep evolving, keep growing fam! ü§ù
